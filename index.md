<!-- # [](#Introduction) About Me --> 

I am Catherine Tong, currently a DPhil (PhD) student at University of Oxford, under the supervision of [Dr. Nicholas Lane](http://niclane.org/). 

<!-- My research is sponsored by the EPSRC Grant. A list of my projects can be found [here](/research/research_index.html). I also keep my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tongcatherine/) up-to-date.  -->

##### [](#interests) Research Interests

I develop and apply machine learning methods to address problems in healthcare. My recent work focuses on using ubiquitous sensing to find connections between people’s daily behaviour and health outcomes. I am particular interested in developing methods which can leverage other resources, including large-scale health records, multimodal sensor streams and graphs (e.g. knowledge graphs and social networks), to overcome the poor data scenarios often resulted from in-the-wild data collection. 

Areas:
* Ubiquitous health monitoring
* Machine learning on graphs
* Ebedding learning of large datasets
* Multimodal learning
* Deep Learning in constained platforms

##### [](#interests) Background
I originally studied Physics at University of Oxford, as my final year project I worked at [CABDyn Centre](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/research/cabdyn) to analyse labour markets using a diffusion model on complex multiplex networks. Upon completion of my first degree I spent a summer at [Nokia Bell Labs Cambridge](https://www.bell-labs.com) before beginning my PhD in the [Cyber Physical Systems Group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/cyberphysical/)  at Oxford.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
